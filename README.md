# hello-world
Just a place to keep my stuff
I am 35 and am finishing my senior year of GIST at the Univeristy of Arizona. I love to be outside and am exited to teach my 2 year old son all the joys that being outside can bring. I have been maried for 8 years we currently live in Houston TX. I am origionally from Utah and miss the four seasons and the ability to escape the city wwith a quick 10 min drive to the mountains. One day we will move back west but until then we travel 3 or 4 times a year to somewhere that has amazing rugged terrain to explore.
